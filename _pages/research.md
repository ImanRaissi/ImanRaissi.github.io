Mountain environments provide fresh water for communities and ecosystems around the globe derived from snowmelt and rainfall; however, the amount of water our mountains hold or release at any given moment is an elusive quantity. Understanding the timing and magnitude of melt and streamflow is essential in preparing societies to make better use of water resources that are under high strain in the Anthropocene, where warmer temperatures and higher wildfire activity generate more uncertainty into the future of mountain hydrology (especially those typically dominated by snow). My work leverages a combination of physics-based modeling, numerical optimization, and various remote sensing platforms to better inform natural resource management decision making and present novel tools to model the changing landscape.
