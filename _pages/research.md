Seasonal snow in mountain environments provide fresh water for communities and ecosystems around the globe; however, the amount of water our mountains hold at any given moment is an elusive quantity. This is because snow is highly variable throughout the landscape. Field methods exist to quantify snowpack properties, and while essential for model validation, these are typically point scale measurements that can be difficult to scale and draw conclusions across the landscape.

My central research interest is to improve our monitoring ability of seasonal snowpacks across the landscape through a variety of remote sensing techniques and snowmelt energy balance modeling. My past work has used imaging spectroscopy data to model snow surface properties such as snow albedo, specific surface area (i.e., grain size), and fractional snow-covered area. I have also worked with researchers to measure snowpack depth using helicopter-borne lidar in the mountains above Boise, Idaho. In my future work I hope to integrate remote sensing methods (including radar and others) to improve our energy balance modeling of snow water in the mountains.

Of particular interest includes watersheds that have been impacted by wildfire. Mountain watersheds can see increased peak streamflows following wildfire due to increased erosion and mass movement. From a snow perspective, the change in forest conditions can alter the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation, thus changing the melt behavior. More attention needs to be focused on monitoring snowpack in forests, especially those that are impacted by wildfire.
